# SpellingBee
A simple spelling bee preparation tool.

My kids are enjoying doing spelling bee competitions. They inspired me to write this simple program to help them preparing the words. Simply update List.txt file (one word each line).

To run this tool:

1. from dos cmd, type [path to venv]\scripts\python.exe [path to main.py]
2. make sure you have your mic and headset/speaker turned on
3. have fun!
